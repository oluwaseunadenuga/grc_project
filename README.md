A hands-on vulnerability assessment project using **Nessus Essentials** (cloud-connected) to identify, analyse and prioritise security weaknesses on a lab network host. The engagement covers the complete end-to-end workflow: scope definition → scan configuration → execution → CSV export → risk-based prioritisation → remediation handoff.

This assessment was performed in a controlled lab environment for educational and portfolio purposes only. No production systems or real-world customer data were scanned or impacted.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates hands-on vulnerability assessment competency using **Nessus Essentials** against a single lab virtual machine. The engagement replicates the initial vulnerability sweep a security analyst would conduct on a new asset, from scope agreement through to producing a prioritised findings report ready for IT remediation handoff.

The lab covers the complete vulnerability management lifecycle:

- Target scoping and rules of engagement definition
- Scan template selection and policy configuration
- Scan execution and dashboard monitoring
- CSV export and spreadsheet-based data structuring
- Risk-based prioritisation by severity and business impact
- Formal reporting and remediation handoff

## Methodology

A structured five-phase approach was followed, aligned to standard vulnerability management lifecycle practices:

<details>

  <summary><strong>Phase 1 — Define Scope & Objectives</strong></summary>

- Confirmed target IP/hostname; verified only the lab host was in scope
- Agreed objective: identify network-level vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Documented rules of engagement and out-of-scope boundaries

</details>

<details>

  <summary><strong>Phase 2 — Select & Configure Scan Template</strong></summary>

- Created a new **Basic Network Scan** in Nessus Essentials
- Reviewed three available scan types:
  - **Basic Network Scan** ← selected
  - Advanced Scan
  - Web Application Scan
- Configured: general settings (name, description, target IP), port scanning (default TCP range), service detection, and performance options appropriate for a lab environment

<img width="940" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d46363c-d01a-4015-b916-07a3b9b2f263" />

<img width="940" height="383" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d72da181-57c2-4798-8961-f0f0785d92e6" />


</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 3 — Run Scan & Monitor Execution</strong></summary>

- Launched the scan and monitored real-time progress from the Nessus dashboard
- Verified: successful scan completion, host discovery, vulnerability population
- Reviewed drill-down views showing per-plugin details, affected port and impacted host

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 4 — Export & Structure Results</strong></summary>

- Exported full findings as **CSV** from Nessus
- Imported CSV into a spreadsheet to:
  - Normalise column names
  - Filter out purely informational findings (if required)
  - Sort and group by severity, plugin family, and affected port

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Phase 5 — Prioritise vulnerabilities & Prepare Remediation Report</strong></summary>

- Grouped findings by severity and potential business impact
- Highlighted **Critical** and **High** severity issues first (e.g. RCE, weak encryption, outdated services)
- Produced a prioritised report and remediation summary for the IT team

</details>

## Scan Configuration

Key configuration elements for the Basic Network Scan:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Template** | Basic Network Scan |
| **Target** | Single Lab VM (IP/hostname) |
| **Scan Type** | Unauthenticated |
| **Port Range** | Default TCP |
| **Service Detection** | Enabled |
| **OS Detection** | Enabled |
| **Host Discovery** | Ping + TCP |
| **Export Format** | CSV |

```
Nessus Scan Templates Reviewed:
  [✓] Basic Network Scan     ← Selected
  [ ] Advanced Scan          ← Reviewed
  [ ] Web Application Scan   ← Reviewed
  [ ] Credentialed Scan      ← Out of scope
```

## Scan Execution & Results

Once the configuration was saved, the Basic Network Scan was executed against the lab host.

During and after execution, the Nessus dashboard displayed:

- Host discovery and overall scan status (running → completed)
- Summary of vulnerabilities by severity: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**
- Drill-down views showing each plugin, affected port, and impacted host

**Scan Summary:**

| Severity | Count |
|----------|:-----:|
| 🔴 Critical | 2 |
| 🟠 High | 5 |
| 🔵 Medium | 11 |
| 🟢 Low | 9 |
| **Total** | **27** |

> Screenshots in the repository show:
> - The scan details page (status, duration, host count)
> - The vulnerability summary chart by severity
> - Example detailed finding views for individual plugins

## Findings Export & Structured Report

After scan completion:

### 1. CSV Export
The full set of Nessus findings was exported as a CSV file. The CSV contains columns including:

```
Plugin ID | Name | Severity | Description | Solution | Host | Port | Protocol | Plugin Family
```

### 2. Data Structuring
The CSV was imported into a spreadsheet to:
- Normalise column names
- Filter out informational findings (optional)
- Sort and group by severity and asset

### 3. Prioritised vulnerability view
 - A dedicated view/report was created to focus on:
 - Critical and High vulnerabilities first.
 - Medium/Low issues grouped by category (e.g. configuration hardening, informational).
- The screenshots in this section show the structured CSV displayed in tabular form and the prioritised vulnerability list derived from it.

## 🎯 Prioritised Vulnerabilities (Risk-Based View)

Vulnerabilities were prioritised based on:

- **Technical severity** — as reported by Nessus (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Potential impact** — on the host and business (e.g. remote code execution vs minor information disclosure)
- **Exploitability** — known exploits, network exposure, proof-of-concept availability

### Priority Tiers

**🔴 Critical — Immediate Action**
> Exploitable remote services allowing code execution or full host compromise. Treat as P1 — must be addressed before the host connects to any production network.

**🟠 High — Urgent**
> Weak or deprecated protocols, missing security patches on exposed services. Schedule remediation within the patch management SLA (typically 7–14 days).

**🔵 Medium — Scheduled**
> Misconfigurations, unnecessary access methods, hardening gaps. Address within the next maintenance window.

**🟢 Low / Informational — Routine**
> Minor findings, limited exploitability. Address as part of ongoing security hygiene and hardening cycles.

## Outcomes & Deliverables

| Deliverable | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Structured CSV Export** | Normalised Nessus findings — Plugin ID, Severity, Host, Port, Protocol, Name, Synopsis, Solution, Plugin Family |
| **Prioritised Vulnerability Report** | Risk-sorted findings report with Critical/High issues first, Medium/Low grouped by category |
| **Scan Configuration Documentation** | Documented scan policy, template selection rationale and configuration settings |
| **Remediation Recommendations** | Actionable, severity-ordered remediation steps with patch references and hardening guidance |

This lab demonstrates the full workflow from scan configuration through to analysis and handoff, reflecting how a security analyst would operate in a real world vulnerability management process.
