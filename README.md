# Datacom GRC Project
## Investigating a cyberattack and producing a comprehensive report"

## INTRODUCTION
This project focuses on investigating a cyberattack by APT34 and producing a comprehensive report, documenting findings and outlining key recommendations for improving a client's cybersecurity posture

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
A leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- **The objective of this project is to help our client conduct an initial investigation into APT34 and evaluate the potential impact of the attack on the organisation:**.
- **Produce a comprehensive report documenting your findings and outlining key recommendations for improving the organisation's cybersecurity posture:**

## RECOMMENDATION
- **Target Top Wastage Causes:** Focus on minimizing the top 10 wastage drivers, especially Time Expiry (TIMEX), which contributes the most to wastage.

- **Optimize RBC Management:** Monitor and manage Red Blood Cell (RBC) stocks carefully due to their consistently high issues and wastage volumes.

- **Adjust for Seasonal Trends:** Align inventory strategies with seasonal and quarterly trends to prevent overstocking during low-demand periods and shortages during peak wastage times (e.g., Q2–Q3 2023).

- **Blood Group-Specific Allocation:** Tailor inventory levels for key blood groups like O Negative and A Negative to address fluctuations in issues and wastage effectively.

- **Enhanced Monitoring of Platelets and Frozen Components:** Closely track and address rising wastage trends in Platelets and Adult FFP, particularly the surges observed in Q1–Q3 2023.
